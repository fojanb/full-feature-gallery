# Gallery
This gallery allows you to tab through the images when they are tiled and select an image and have it open up larger with an overlay. The image has arrows on each side, 
allowing the user to navigate back and forth by clicking them or using the arrow keys, you can press the escape key to close the overlay view. 
It is basically a full featured gallery.
The idea with the Gallery is that at the end of writing the code, we have built almost like a plugin and we can go ahead and use it on the page.
